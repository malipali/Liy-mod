I kinda wanna do this song
The reason i decided not to do it at first was because making chromatic scales was a pain in the ass, but now with the program it was way easier to do them
We can add it as a bonus song after the week 3 update that you unlock by beating the bonus week
If you think making sprites for all the EXITors is too much work we could try to find another artist or find people to work on the other parts of the mod like charting and stuff
