I kinda wanna do this song
The reason i decided not to do it at first was because making chromatic scales was a pain in the ass, but now with the program it was way easier to do them
We can add it as a bonus song after the week 3 update that you unlock by beating the bonus week
If you think making sprites for all the EXITors is too much work we could try to find another artist or find people to work on the other parts of the mod like charting and stuff

tbh idc anymore about doing all of that work
also we need to make a transition animation for liy to four because rn it looks weird
and i'll have to figure out how to code a beam bc animating one will be too big for the spritesheet
there might be a lua function, or maybe make it a seperate spritesheet

I was thinking more like Four's arm comes from offscreen, grabs Liy and pulls her really fast and the sweep sound that plays being like that sound the air makes when something moves really fast, like when a car passes it makes that sound idk how to explain
If you want to make Four hitting her with a beam it's fine by me tho
