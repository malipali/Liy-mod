Here are my plans, if i have a different idea i'll add it here

Week 1:
Liy is trying to find a way to get out of Four, she finds BF instead
Sweetie Switchy - Generic cute song
Liy asks if BF doesn't want to escape from there, he says she has to beat him first
Click Clock - Second song where the tension rises
Liy flips her switch like in BFB 5 as the last resort to beat BF
Elimination - Fast and hard, Four comes in and grabs Liy at some point and then they sings on Liy's place
Four asks why BF is there, BF says it was GF's dad that sent them there, he asks Four to take them to the exit.

Week 2:
Four takes them to the EXIT, Pencil doesn't like BF
Bember - Generic pop song
BF explains that he meant he wanted to go back, but before they go Liy asks to form a truce with BF
Truce - Cute and happy song
Four asks to sing one last song after they bring BF back to where he came from
Algebralien - Fast and fun song
I think i'll leave this one without an ending

Week 3:
Liy challenges Foldy to a battle
Salty Switchy - Remix of Sweetie Switchy
Foldy and Liy insult each other, Stapy tries to calm them down but fails
Appisiote - Angry song, but not that hard
Stapy gets them to become friend again (Somehow)
Redemption - A last song for Liy and Foldy to make up
Ending screen with a "thanks for playing" written in it
