It's ok, that's how making a mod goes
Also what do you think of adding an Accelerant cover to the mod? 
You would have to animate Four kicking GF off the speakers, Four singing on the speakers, Four getting hit by a flying Pillow and Four trying to get Pillow off their head like in that one scene in BFB 1
If that's too much work (which i think it is) we can add it in a later update since this update is already kinda belated

(malpal response because i'm too lazy to make something new):
i'm fine with that, we should add that in an update though, i agree that this version is getting too big
just checked, atm the update is 13mb bigger than the original release
