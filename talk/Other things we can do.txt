This is a list of other things we can do before weeks 2 and 3
- Update Liy sprites
- Make proper dialogue sprites for Four
- Change title in title screen to include mod's name
- Liy dancing on title screen
- Actually make easy and normal chartings
Also since we play as Liy in week 3 i think we should change the name to "the Liy mod" instead of "vs Liy"
