1. i have to make sprites for Pencil, Bracelety, Roboty, 8-Ball, Stapy, David, Match, Firey Jr., Dora, and Foldy, i think we should add other people to this because making 10 spritesheets is going to be absolutely insane
also because we're probably eventually gonna hit a wall and not know how to do something
2. how exactly are we gonna do the exit backgrounds? 
they're 3d.
