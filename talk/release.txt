I think we'll be ready for release within the next week
I just need to finish the elimination chart, the cutscenes, the logo, title screen, and the difficulties (and probably need to fix liy's left pose once and for all)
you can update the gamejolt, and i'll make a gamebanana
I'm guessing it'll be ready by like thursday, maybe friday, either way i'm hoping for friday
goals:
titlescreen/pose: i finish today
cutscene: finish tommorow
Charts: possibly tommorow? probably friday
